**Documenting my Cyber journey- skills, projects, and learning.**  
Hi, I'm Iyanuoluwa! 
I am a Law Graduate, with a strong interest in the intersection of Law and Technology, especially Data privacy and Cybersecurity.
I enjoy learning, exploring new ideas, and contributing to meaningful projects. 

As a Cybersecurity newbie, I've gained hands-on experience with essential tools such as Github, VS Code, and Virtual box. 
I am actively improving my cybersecurity skills and building a solid portfolio. 

I am currently exploring both Offensive and Defensive Cybersecurity paths. I'm also open to GRC(Governance, Risk & Compliance) considering my legal background.
Right now, I'm focused on building practical, real-world cybersecurity projects, gaining technical expertise, preparing for industry certifications, and ultimately becoming excellent at what i do.
